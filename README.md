## Description

MixedAviation is running on unity 2022.3.11f1\
Setup for Hololens 2\

The idea of the project is to create a visual experience for pilots of the pre-flight and in-flight aspects of flight. Pre-flight is the way to plan your flight. This is done in the project in a way that the terrain and all obstacles in said terrain are shown and visible to help the pilot find a good route for their next trip. This is mostly completed but the need for more user input and interaction is something that was in the works but didn’t se the light of day. In-flight was to have everything visible to the pilot and letting the pilot interact with mountains, villages or other named terrain to find their location, all the mountains and hazards are displayed in world and they interaction to  get the name of the object/terrain works but further implementation needed more time.
